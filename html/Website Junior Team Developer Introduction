        <h1> Junior Developer Team Introduction </h1>
        <p>
            Team building is an ongoing process that helps a work group evolve into a cohesive unit. The team members not only share expectations for accomplishing group tasks, but trust and support one another and respect one another's individual differences. Your role as a team builder is to lead your team toward cohesiveness and productivity. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The team consists of the following members, with an average age of 13-14 years, mainly from two private secondary schools, i.e., Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf and Collège Notre-Dame (Montréal). They are eager to learn new knowledge and more difficult challenges. It is hoped that through the training of the website development training camp, they can quickly master the relevant knowledge of computers and data, and finally be able to complete the development of commercial websites or application software in the form of a team.
